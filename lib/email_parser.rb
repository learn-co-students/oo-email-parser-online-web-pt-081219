# Build a class EmailAddressParser that accepts a string of unformatted 
# emails. The parse method on the class should separate them into
# unique email addresses. The delimiters to support are commas (',')
# or whitespace (' ').

class EmailAddressParser
attr_accessor :emails

def initialize(csv_email)
  @emails = csv_email # or just email works vs csv_email
end

def parse
  emails.delete(',').split.uniq
end

end
